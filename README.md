# CV-Analyzer

The **CV Analyzer Tool** is a Python application that helps evaluate a candidate's CV against a job posting. It can read a PDF CV or TXT and pull out key words from both the CV and the job description. The tool checks how well the CV matches the job posting. It shows the matching percentage and points out any missing or mismatched keywords.

## Features

- **PDF CV Parsing**: Reads and extracts text from PDF format CVs.
- **Keyword Extraction**: Extracts key terms from both the CV and the job description.
- **Keyword Matching**: Compares the extracted keywords from the CV with the job description and calculates the matching percentage.
- **Missing Keywords Report**: Identifies any missing keywords from the CV that are present in the job description.
